Snapshots = Commits. This means whenever a single file is committed, Git takes note/status of the entire files in the folder.
With every snapshot, git creates a hash value. This hash value can be used to find out the status of the files at that checkout.
git log -> provides the commit lists with their hash values and associated datas
git log --pretty=oneline -> provides the commit lists with their has values only.
